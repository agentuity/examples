# Agentuity with Riza Example

[![Deploy with Agentuity](https://app.agentuity.com/img/deploy.svg)](https://app.agentuity.com/deploy)

This project showcases how you can execute code generated by LLMs with Riza.
This example uses the Anthropic SDK with tool calling.

## Implementation Details

### Tool Configuration

The agent configures Claude (via Anthropic SDK) with a code execution tool that supports:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- PHP
- TypeScript

### Code Execution Flow

1. The agent receives a text prompt from the user
2. Claude processes the prompt and may respond with:
   - Regular text responses
   - Code execution requests
3. For code execution requests, Riza:
   - Runs the code in a secure environment
   - Returns both stdout or stderr (if applicable)

## Getting Started

To run this example locally,

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have installed the Agentuity CLI (`curl -fsS https://agentuity.sh | sh`)
3. Run `agentuity project import` to import the project into your Agentuity account.
4. Sign up for Riza and create an API key. Then you can put it in your `.env` file (match formatting in `.env.example`.)
4. Run `agentuity dev` to start the local development server.
