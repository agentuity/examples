# 🎥 YouTube Agent

An intelligent YouTube content analyzer built with Agno and Agentuity that provides detailed video breakdowns, timestamps, and summaries. Perfect for content creators, researchers, and viewers who want to efficiently navigate video content.

## Features

- 🎥 Comprehensive video analysis
- ⏱️ Precise timestamp generation
- 📝 Detailed content summaries
- 🎯 Topic identification and organization
- 📊 Content structure breakdown

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher
- **UV**: Version 0.5.25 or higher ([Documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Authentication

Before using Agentuity, you need to authenticate:

```bash
agentuity login
```

This command will open a browser window where you can log in to your Agentuity account.

### Development Mode

Run your project in development mode with:

```bash
agentuity dev
```

This will start your project and open a new browser window connecting your agent to the Agentuity Console in DevMode, allowing you to test and debug your agent in real-time.

You can also start your project in development mode without connecting to the Agentuity Console:

```bash
uv run server.py
```
