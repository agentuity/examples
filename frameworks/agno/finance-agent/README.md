## Agno Finance Agent

This agent is a direct port of the Agno Finance Agent from the official Agno documentation, wrapped for use with the Agentuity platform.

**Original Source**: https://docs.agno.com/examples/agents/finance-agent

### Description

This example shows how to create a sophisticated financial analyst that provides comprehensive market insights using real-time data. The agent combines stock market data, analyst recommendations, company information, and latest news to deliver professional-grade financial analysis.

### Features

- **Real-time Stock Data**: Latest pricing, 52-week highs/lows, and market metrics
- **Financial Analysis**: P/E ratios, market cap, EPS, and other key fundamentals
- **Analyst Insights**: Professional recommendations and rating changes
- **Market Context**: Industry trends, competitive analysis, and sentiment indicators
- **News Integration**: Latest company news and market developments

### Example Prompts

- "What's the latest news and financial performance of Apple (AAPL)?"
- "Give me a detailed analysis of Tesla's (TSLA) current market position"
- "How are Microsoft's (MSFT) financials looking? Include analyst recommendations"
- "Analyze NVIDIA's (NVDA) stock performance and future outlook"
- "What's the market saying about Amazon's (AMZN) latest quarter?"

### Framework Preservation

This implementation preserves ALL original Agno framework functionality:
- Uses `agno.agent.Agent` for the core agent logic
- Leverages `agno.models.openai.OpenAIChat` for AI model integration
- Utilizes `agno.tools.yfinance.YFinanceTools` for financial data retrieval
- Maintains all original instructions, configurations, and behavior

The Agentuity wrapper simply provides the interface layer while keeping the Agno agent intact.
