# Quickstart

This guide shows you how to set up and use Pinecone Database for high-performance semantic search.

<Tip>
  To get started in your browser, use the [Quickstart colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pinecone-io/examples/blob/master/docs/pinecone-quickstart.ipynb). To try Pinecone Database locally before creating an account, use [Pinecone Local](/guides/operations/local-development).
</Tip>

## 1. Install an SDK

[Pinecone SDKs](/reference/pinecone-sdks) provide convenient programmatic access to the [Pinecone APIs](/reference/api/introduction).

Install the SDK for your preferred language:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Python
  pip install pinecone
  ```

```shell JavaScript
npm install @pinecone-database/pinecone
```

```shell Java
# Maven
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pinecone</groupId>
  <artifactId>pinecone-client</artifactId>
  <version>5.0.0</version>
</dependency>

# Gradle
implementation "io.pinecone:pinecone-client:5.0.0"
```

```shell Go
go get github.com/pinecone-io/go-pinecone/v4/pinecone
```

```shell C#
# .NET Core CLI
dotnet add package Pinecone.Client

# NuGet CLI
nuget install Pinecone.Client
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Get an API key

You need an API key to make calls to your Pinecone project.

Create a new API key in the [Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/keys), or use the widget below to generate a key. If you don't have a Pinecone account, the widget will sign you up for the free [Starter plan](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/).

<div style={{minWidth: '450px', minHeight:'152px'}}>
  <div id="pinecone-connect-widget">
    <div class="connect-widget-skeleton">
      <div class="skeleton-content" />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Your generated API key:

```shell
"{{YOUR_API_KEY}}"
```

## 3. Create an index

In Pinecone, there are two types of indexes for storing vector data: [Dense indexes](/guides/index-data/indexing-overview#dense-indexes) store <Tooltip tip="Each number in a dense vector is a point in a multidimensional space. Vectors that are closer together in that space are semantically similar.">dense vectors</Tooltip> for semantic search, and [sparse indexes](/guides/index-data/indexing-overview#sparse-indexes) store <Tooltip tip="A sparse vector has a very large number of dimensions, where only a small proportion of values are non-zero. The dimensions represent words from a dictionary, and the values represent the importance of these words in the document.">sparse vectors</Tooltip> for lexical/keyword search.

For this quickstart, [create a dense index](/guides/index-data/create-an-index#create-a-dense-index) that is integrated with an [embedding model hosted by Pinecone](/guides/index-data/create-an-index#embedding-models). With integrated models, you upsert and search with text and have Pinecone generate vectors automatically.

<Note>
  If you prefer to use external embedding models, see [Bring your own vectors](/guides/index-data/indexing-overview#bring-your-own-vectors).
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # Import the Pinecone library

[Upsert](/guides/index-data/upsert-data) the sample dataset into a new [namespace](/guides/index-data/indexing-overview#namespaces) in your index.

Because your index is integrated with an embedding model, you provide the textual statements and Pinecone converts them to dense vectors automatically.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # Target the index
  dense_index = pc.Index(index_name)

# Upsert the records into a namespace

dense_index.upsert_records("example-namespace", records)

````

```javascript JavaScript
// Target the index
const index = pc.index(indexName).namespace("example-namespace");

// Upsert the records into a namespace
await index.upsertRecords(records);
````

```java Java
// Add to the Quickstart class:
// Target the index
Index index = new Index(config, connection, "quickstart-java");
// Upsert the records into a namespace
index.upsertRecords("example-namespace", upsertRecords);
```

```go Go
// Add to the main function:
// Target the index
idxModel, err := pc.DescribeIndex(ctx, indexName)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to describe index \"%v\": %v", indexName, err)
}

idxConnection, err := pc.Index(pinecone.NewIndexConnParams{Host: idxModel.Host, Namespace: "example-namespace"})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to create IndexConnection for Host: %v: %v", idxModel.Host, err)
}

// Upsert the records into a namespace
err = idxConnection.UpsertRecords(ctx, records)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to upsert vectors: %v", err)
}
```

```csharp C#
// Upsert the records into a namespace
await index.UpsertRecordsAsync(
    "example-namespace",
    records
);
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  To control costs when ingesting large datasets (10,000,000+ records), use [import](/guides/index-data/import-data) instead of upsert.
</Tip>

Pinecone is eventually consistent, so there can be a slight delay before new or changed records are visible to queries. You can [view index stats](/guides/index-data/check-data-freshness) to check if the current vector count matches the number of vectors you upserted (50):

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # Wait for the upserted vectors to be indexed
  import time
  time.sleep(10)

# View stats for the index

stats = dense_index.describe_index_stats()
print(stats)

````

```javascript JavaScript
// Wait for the upserted vectors to be indexed
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10000));

// View stats for the index
const stats = await index.describeIndexStats();
console.log(stats);
````

```java Java
// Add to the Quickstart class:
// Wait for upserted vectors to be indexed
Thread.sleep(5000);

// View stats for the index
DescribeIndexStatsResponse indexStatsResponse = index.describeIndexStats();
System.out.println(indexStatsResponse);
```

```go Go
// Add to the main function:
// View stats for the index
stats, err := idxConnection.DescribeIndexStats(ctx)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to describe index \"%v\": %v", indexName, err)
} else {
    fmt.Printf("%+v", prettifyStruct(*stats))
}
```

```csharp C#
var indexStatsResponse = await index.DescribeIndexStatsAsync(new DescribeIndexStatsRequest());

Console.WriteLine(indexStatsResponse);
```

</CodeGroup>

The response looks like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  {'dimension': 1024,
   'index_fullness': 0.0,
   'metric': 'cosine',
   'namespaces': {'example-namespace': {'vector_count': 50}},
   'total_vector_count': 50,
   'vector_type': 'dense'}
  ```

```javascript JavaScript
{
  namespaces: { 'example-namespace': { recordCount: 50 } },
  dimension: 1024,
  indexFullness: 0,
  totalRecordCount: 50
}

  value {
    vector_count: 50
  }
}
dimension: 1024
total_vector_count: 50
metric: "cosine"
vector_type: "dense"
```

```go Go
{
  "dimension": 1024,
  "index_fullness": 0,
  "total_vector_count": 50,
  "namespaces": {
    "example-namespace": {
      "vector_count": 50
    }
  }
}
```

  "metric": "cosine",
  "vectorType": "dense"
}
```

## 5. Semantic search

[Search the dense index](/guides/search/semantic-search) for ten records that are most semantically similar to the query, "Famous historical structures and monuments".

Again, because your index is integrated with an embedding model, you provide the query as text and Pinecone converts the text to a dense vector automatically.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # Define the query
  query = "Famous historical structures and monuments"

# Search the dense index

results = dense_index.search(
namespace="example-namespace",
query={
"top_k": 10,
"inputs": {
'text': query
}
}
)

# Print the results

for hit in results['result']['hits']:
print(f"id: {hit['_id']:<5} | score: {round(hit['_score'], 2):<5} | category: {hit['fields']['category']:<10} | text: {hit['fields']['chunk_text']:<50}")

````

```javascript JavaScript
// Define the query
const query = 'Famous historical structures and monuments';

// Search the dense index
const results = await index.searchRecords({
  query: {
    topK: 10,
    inputs: { text: query },
  },
});

// Print the results
results.result.hits.forEach(hit => {
  console.log(`id: ${hit.id}, score: ${hit.score.toFixed(2)}, category: ${hit.fields.category}, text: ${hit.fields.chunk_text}`);
});
````

```java Java
// Add to the Quickstart class:
// Define the query
String query = "Famous historical structures and monuments";
List<String> fields = new ArrayList<>();
fields.add("category");
fields.add("chunk_text");

// Search the dense index
SearchRecordsResponse recordsResponse = index.searchRecordsByText(query,  "example-namespace", fields, 10, null, null);

// Print the results
System.out.println(recordsResponse);
```

```go Go
// Add to the main function:
// Define the query
query := "Famous historical structures and monuments"

// Search the dense index
res, err := idxConnection.SearchRecords(ctx, &pinecone.SearchRecordsRequest{
    Query: pinecone.SearchRecordsQuery{
        TopK: 10,
        Inputs: &map[string]interface{}{
            "text": query,
        },
    },
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to search records: %v", err)
}
fmt.Printf(prettifyStruct(res))
```

```csharp C#
// Search the dense index
var response = await index.SearchRecordsAsync(
    "example-namespace",
    new SearchRecordsRequest
    {
        Query = new SearchRecordsRequestQuery
        {
            TopK = 10,
            Inputs = new Dictionary<string, object?> { { "text", "Famous historical structures and monuments" } },
        },
        Fields = ["category", "chunk_text"],
    }
);

Console.WriteLine(response);
```

Notice that most of the results are about historical structures and monuments. However, a few unrelated statements are included as well and are ranked high in the list, for example, a statement about Shakespeare.

## 6. Rerank results

To get a more accurate ranking, search again but this time [rerank the initial results](/guides/search/rerank-results) based on their relevance to the query.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python {10-14}
  # Search the dense index and rerank results
  reranked_results = dense_index.search(
      namespace="example-namespace",
      query={
          "top_k": 10,
          "inputs": {
              'text': query
          }
      },
      rerank={
          "model": "bge-reranker-v2-m3",
          "top_n": 10,
          "rank_fields": ["chunk_text"]
      }   
  )

# Print the reranked results

for hit in reranked_results['result']['hits']:
print(f"id: {hit['_id']}, score: {round(hit['_score'], 2)}, text: {hit['fields']['chunk_text']}, category: {hit['fields']['category']}")

````

```javascript JavaScript {7-11}
// Search the dense index and rerank results
const rerankedResults = await index.searchRecords({
  query: {
    topK: 10,
    inputs: { text: query },
  },
  rerank: {
    model: 'bge-reranker-v2-m3',
    topN: 10,
    rankFields: ['chunk_text'],
  },
});

// Print the reranked results
rerankedResults.result.hits.forEach(hit => {
  console.log(`id: ${hit.id}, score: ${hit.score.toFixed(2)}, text: ${hit.fields.chunk_text}, category: ${hit.fields.category}`);
});
````

```java Java {9}
// Add to the Quickstart class:
// Define the rerank parameters

rankFields.add("chunk_text");
SearchRecordsRequestRerank rerank = new SearchRecordsRequestRerank()
        .query(query)

        .rankFields(rankFields);

// Search the dense index and rerank results
SearchRecordsResponse recordsResponseReranked = index.searchRecordsByText(query,  "example-namespace", fields, 10, null, rerank );

// Print the reranked results
System.out.println(recordsResponseReranked);
```

```go Go {11-15}
// Add to the main function:

topN := int32(10)
resReranked, err := idxConnection.SearchRecords(ctx, &pinecone.SearchRecordsRequest{

        TopN:       &topN,
        RankFields: []string{"chunk_text"},
    },
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to search records: %v", err)
}
fmt.Printf(prettifyStruct(resReranked))
```

```csharp C# {12-17}

            TopN = 10,
            RankFields = ["chunk_text"],
        }
    }
);

Console.WriteLine(responseReranked);
```

Notice that all of the most relevant results about historical structures and monuments are now ranked highest.

## 7. Improve results

[Reranking results](/guides/search/rerank-results) is one of the most effective ways to improve search accuracy and relevance, but there are many other techniques to consider. For example:

- [Filtering by metadata](/guides/search/filter-by-metadata): When records contain additional metadata, you can limit the search to records matching a [filter expression](/guides/index-data/indexing-overview#metadata-filter-expressions).

- [Hybrid search](/guides/search/hybrid-search): You can add [lexical search](/guides/search/lexical-search) to capture precise keyword matches (e.g., product SKUs, email addresses, domain-specific terms) in addition to semantic matches.

- [Chunking strategies](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/): You can chunk your content in different ways to get better results. Consider factors like the length of the content, the complexity of queries, and how results will be used in your application.

## 8. Clean up

When you no longer need your example index, delete it as follows:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # Delete the index
  pc.delete_index(index_name)
  ```

```javascript JavaScript
// Delete the index
await pc.deleteIndex(indexName);
```

```java Java
// Add to the Quickstart class:
// Delete the index
pc.deleteIndex(indexName);
```

```go Go
// Add to the main function:
// Delete the index
err = pc.DeleteIndex(ctx, indexName)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to delete index: %v", err)
} else {
    fmt.Println("Index \"%v\" deleted successfully", indexName)
}
```

```csharp C#
// Delete the index
await pinecone.DeleteIndexAsync(indexName);
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  For production indexes, consider [enabling deletion protection](/guides/manage-data/manage-indexes#configure-deletion-protection).
