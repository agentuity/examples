# 🤖 Mastra Supervisor Agent

This example demonstrates a supervisor agent pattern using Mastra, where multiple specialized agents collaborate on different aspects of a task. The supervisor agent coordinates a copywriter and editor to create polished blog posts.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Bun**: Version 1.2.4 or higher

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Authentication

Before using Agentuity, you need to authenticate:

```bash
agentuity login
```

This command will open a browser window where you can log in to your Agentuity account.

### Creating a New Agent

To create a new agent in your project:

```bash
agentuity agent new
```

Follow the interactive prompts to configure your agent.

### Development Mode

Run your project in development mode with:

```bash
agentuity dev
```

This will start your project and open a new browser window connecting your agent to the Agentuity Console in DevMode, allowing you to test and debug your agent in real-time.

## 🌐 Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your agent to the Agentuity Cloud:

```bash
agentuity deploy
```

This command will bundle your agent and deploy it to the cloud, making it accessible via the Agentuity platform.

## 📚 Project Structure

```
├── src/
│   └── agents/
│       └── supervisor-agent/
│           └── index.ts        # Supervisor agent implementation
├── node_modules/               # Dependencies
├── package.json                # Project dependencies and scripts
├── agentuity.yaml              # Agentuity project configuration
└── .env.example                # Environment variables template
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

This example consists of three agents:

1. **Copywriter Agent** - Writes initial blog post content based on a given topic
2. **Editor Agent** - Refines and edits the content to improve quality and readability
3. **Publisher Agent (Supervisor)** - Coordinates the entire process by calling the copywriter first, then the editor

The supervisor agent uses Mastra's tool system to orchestrate the workflow between specialized agents.

## 🔧 Configuration

Your project configuration is stored in `agentuity.yaml`. This file defines your agents, development settings, and deployment configuration.

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Environment Variables

You can set environment variables for your project:

```bash
agentuity env set KEY VALUE
```

### Secrets Management

For sensitive information, use secrets:

```bash
agentuity env set --secret KEY VALUE
```
