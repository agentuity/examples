# Agentuity SDK Authentication
# When running locally with 'agentuity dev', authentication is handled automatically
# No additional environment variables are required for this example

# The Agentuity platform manages OpenAI API access through the AI Gateway
# No OPENAI_API_KEY is needed - the platform handles all provider credentials
