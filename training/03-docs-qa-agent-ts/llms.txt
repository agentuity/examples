# Agentuity
> The cloud, built for AI agents. Deploy, run, and scale autonomous agents on infrastructure designed for the future, not the past.

## Product Features

### AI Gateway - One gateway, every model

Access OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, and more through a single interface. No API keys to manage, seamless model switching, and detailed cost tracking for every request.

 - Zero Configuration: No API keys to manage, no rate limits to worry about, no billing accounts to set up across dozens of providers. Your agents automatically get access to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, Mistral, and more. Just start coding.
 - Swap models with ease: Easily experiment with different models to find the best performance for your use case. Compare OpenAI's reasoning with Anthropic's creativity or Google's speedâ€”all with the same code and unified billing.
 - Deep Observability: Every request gets detailed telemetry via OpenTelemetry: token usage, costs, latency, error rates, and span-level debugging. Track model performance across providers and optimize your agent workflows with real data.

### DevMode - Build agents locally, as if they were in prod

Test and debug your AI agents locally before deploying to production. DevMode provides the exact same environment and capabilities you'll have in the cloud, enabling fearless development with instant feedback loops.

 - Local-First Development: Run your agents locally with the same APIs, authentication, and features you'll have in production.
 - Agent Lifecycle Management: Create, test, debug, and deploy agents with the Agentuity CLI. Manage agent configurations, authentication, and dependencies locally before pushing to production.
 - Production Parity: Your local DevMode environment mirrors production functionality. Same APIs, same communication flows, same error handling.

### Instant I/O - Seamless agent connectivity

Give your agent superpowers â€” a phone number, an email, a webhook, or an API â€” using an intelligent routing system that ensures your data flows seamlessly to the right places at the right time.

 - Messaging & Email: Send and receive SMS messages and emails directly to and from your agents.
 - APIs & Webhooks: Trigger your agents via REST APIs or webhooks. Schedule agents with Cron expressions for recurring tasks.
 - Chat Platforms: Integrations for Discord, Slack, Teams, and Telegram so your agents can receive and send messages.
 - Agent-to-Agent I/O: Language and framework-agnostic agent communication. Your agents can talk to each other in one line of code, whether you're using CrewAI on Python or Mastra on Bun.

### Observability - Complete visibility into your AI agents

Monitor, debug, and optimize your AI agents with comprehensive observability. Get structured logging, out-of-the-box telemetry, and advanced tracing for complete transparency into agent behavior and performance.

 - Structured Logging: Capture detailed information about agent activities with event logs, error logs, and performance logs. All logs are structured and easily searchable through the Agentuity Console.
 - Out-of-the-Box Telemetry: Automatic integration with OpenTelemetry provides performance metrics, execution traces, and session insights. Track execution times, resource consumption, and identify optimization opportunities.
 - Advanced Agent Tracing: Customize tracing, attributes, and events. Output data directly into session detail span diagrams for deep visibility into complex agent workflows and behavior.

### Storage - Unified storage for AI agents

One API for vector, key-value, and object storage, built for agent workflows.

 - Vector Database: Embed, upsert, and query documents (text, JSON, etc). Great for RAG, agent memory, semantic search, and more.
 - Key-Value Store: Great for session orchestration, agent memory, feature flags, and agent handoffs.
 - Object Storage: Durable blob storage for transcripts, artifacts, images, audio, reports, and more. S3-compatible APIs for familiar object storage operations.

## Core Benefits

### Build with _your_ stack

Integrate with leading LLMs, popular frameworks including LangChain and CrewAI, and your preferred programming languages. Infrastructure that adapts to your tech stack, not the other way around.

### Seamless agent collaboration

Break down framework barriers. Agent-native infrastructure enables seamless communication between agents built with different toolsâ€”whether they're using CrewAI, LangChain, or custom implementations. Let your agents collaborate naturally across any platform.

### Fastest path to production

Skip the complex setup of traditional cloud providers. Deploy your AI agents with a single command; no IAM, security groups, or load balancers to configure. Agent-native infrastructure handles everything else. Still want to use AWS, Azure, or GCP? Deploy agents directly into your AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premise VMware environment using our fully managed Agentic Cloud platform.

### First-class dev experience

Build, test, and deploy AI agents with confidence. Agentuity's comprehensive toolkit includes a CLI, web interface, pre-built agent library, and local dev mode designed for rapid iteration.

## About Agentuity

> Mission control for the AI agent revolution. We're building the infrastructure layer that powers the next generation of autonomous AI applications.

### Our story

Agentuity was born from seeing developers and companies struggle with the same challenges: building and rebuilding infrastructure to manage AI agents at scale.

We envisioned a world where teams could focus on building incredible AI applications without worrying about the operational complexity beneath. That's why we created the first mission control center for AI agents.

Agentuity was founded by Jeff Haynie, Rick Blalock, Matthew Congrove, Robin Diddams and Bobby Christopher in early-2025 in Austin, Texas.

### Our vision

We believe in the near future there will be a world of autonomous AI software agents. This with the best of human ingenuity will solve the world's most complex problems.

We believe today's edge based cloud computing is insufficient to support the unique needs of millions of autonomous AI agents, which will be deployed to work in the real world and leverage proprietary knowledge and tools inside the enterprise.

We believe tomorrow's fully autonomous AI agents will require the ability to self-learn, self-replicate and self-heal in a safe, secure and scalable computing environment.

We are building this future today.

### Backed by industry-leading investors

In early 2025, we raised a $4M seed round led by top-tier investors ("boldstart ventures", "Bloomberg Beta", "Southern Equity" and "OneSixOne Ventures") who share our vision for the future of AI infrastructure. Our backers bring deep expertise in enterprise software, AI/ML, and building developer platforms at scale.
