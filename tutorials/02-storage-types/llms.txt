# Agentuity
> The cloud, built for AI agents. Deploy, run, and scale autonomous agents on infrastructure designed for the future, not the past.

## Features

### Build with _your_ stack
Integrate with leading LLMs, popular frameworks including LangChain and CrewAI, and your preferred programming languages. Infrastructure that adapts to your tech stack, not the other way around.

### Seamless agent collaboration
Break down framework barriers. Agent-native infrastructure enables seamless communication between agents built with different toolsâ€”whether they're using CrewAI, LangChain, or custom implementations. Let your agents collaborate naturally across any platform.

### Fastest path to production
Skip the complex setup of traditional cloud providers. Deploy your AI agents with a single command; no IAM, security groups, or load balancers to configure. Agent-native infrastructure handles everything else. Still want to use AWS, Azure, or GCP? Deploy Agents directly into your AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premise VMWare environment using our fully managed Agentic Cloud platform.

### First-class dev experience
Build, test, and deploy AI agents with confidence. Agentuity's comprehensive toolkit includes a CLI, web interface, pre-built agent library, and local dev mode designed for rapid iteration.

### Instructions in, magic out
Connect your agents to any channelâ€”chat, webhooks, email, SMS, voice, or custom interfacesâ€”using an intelligent routing system that ensures your data flows seamlessly to the right places at the right time.

### Unified AI gateway
Stop managing the complexity of multiple model providers and their API keys and tokensâ€”just use the gateway to connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or any other provider. Pay only for what you use.

### Real-time monitoring and analytics
Gain full transparency into your agents with real-time metrics on performance, memory, and cost. Instantly spot issues, optimize usage, and make data-driven decisions to maximize efficiency and control.

## About Agentuity
> Mission control for the AI agent revolution. We're building the infrastructure layer that powers the next generation of autonomous AI applications.

### Our story
Agentuity was born from seeing developers and companies struggle with the same challenges: building and rebuilding infrastructure to manage AI agents at scale.

We envisioned a world where teams could focus on building incredible AI applications without worrying about the operational complexity beneath. That's why we created the first mission control center for AI agents.

Agentuity was founded by Jeff Haynie, Rick Blalock, Matthew Congrove, Robin Diddams and Bobby Christopher in early-2025 in Austin, Texas.

### Our vision
We believe in the near future there will be a world of autonomous AI software agents. This with the best of human ingenuity will solve the world's most complex problems.

We believe today's edge based cloud computing is insufficient to support the unique needs of millions of autonomous AI agents, which will be deployed to work in the real world and leverage proprietary knowledge and tools inside the enterprise.

We believe tomorrow's fully autonomous AI agents will require the ability to self-learn, self-replicate and self-heal in a safe, secure and scalable computing environment.

We are building this future today.

### Backed by industry-leading investors
In early 2025, we raised a $4M seed round led by top-tier investors ("boldstart ventures", "Bloomberg Beta", "Southern Equity" and "OneSixOne Ventures") who share our vision for the future of AI infrastructure. Our backers bring deep expertise in enterprise software, AI/ML, and building developer platforms at scale.
